        In the United States, Autism can be found 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls. According to <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/"target="_blank">Autsim Speaks</a>, "Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, refers to a range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as by unique strengths and differences. We now know that there is not one autism but many types, caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences."
